                Dr. Sheldon Lee Cooper B.Sc., M.Sc., M.A., Ph.D., Sc.D., is a Caltech theoretical physicist.
                Next to his best friend Leonard Hofstadter, heâ€™s the main protagonist of The Big Bang Theory and the
                titular protagonist of Young Sheldon.

                Originally from East Texas, Sheldon started college at the age of 11, receiving his first Ph.D. at the
                age of 16. As a kid, Sheldon was involved in numerous experiments as a "wunderkind," such as his plan to
                provide free electricity for his hometown by building a nuclear reactor - a plan that government
                pen-pushers stopped, claiming that it is illegal to store yellowcake uranium in a garden shed. Proudly
                geeky, he has no qualms about speaking Klingon, wearing vintage t-shirts sporting super-hero logos, or
                spouting various historical and cultural anecdotes (e.g., his account of the introduction of the fork
                into Thailand). While he may claim to be the perfect human specimen, Sheldon does have his faults.
                Sheldon is characterized by a strict adherence to routine and hygiene, an overly intellectual
                personality, a tenuous understanding of irony, sarcasm and humor, and a general lack of humility or
                empathy, the former of which is demonstrated in the fact that he has no problem voicing to his peers his
                admiration for his superior intellect. These qualities, along with his penchant for pranks, are his
                character's main source of humor. He is often considered to be the most iconic character of the show.
                Sheldon has developed a more sociable personality due to the influences of his friend Penny and his wife
                Amy but some of it does not always show up.
